## What is the WhatsApp moment?

At the TiE LeapFrog event in last year August, Nandan Nilekani shared a provocation: “are we at a WhatsApp Moment in finance?” He explained how in 2009, the peer-to-peer messaging space was “disrupted” by WhatsApp. Not because it pushed people to sign-in to all other websites and services using a WhatsApp account, the way Google and Facebook was pushing. Not because it pushed people to keep buying special SMS packs, the way the telecos were pushing. But because WhatsApp embraces an already existing unique digital ID – the mobile phone number – and used it to connect people to each other – using the address book as the already existing “social graph” – and offered messaging service at minimal (data) cost. Furthermore, Nandan shared that in “rural India”, they call WhatsApp nothing but “Free SMS.”
